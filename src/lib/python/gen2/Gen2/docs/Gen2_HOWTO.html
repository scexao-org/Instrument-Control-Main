<a name="inst1">
<h3>Step 1: Required hardware</h3></a>
<ul>
  <li>Intel x86 class machine(s) with "reasonably large" amount of RAM or
      SPARC machine(s) with same.  May run on other architectures (Your
      Mileage May Vary).
</ul>

<a name="inst2">
<h3>Step 2: Required software</h3></a>
<ul>
  <li> Reasonable Linux or Solaris distribution;
      <p>
  <li> Python 2.3 (or later) installed (for any "reasonable" linux
      distro this will be the case);
      <p>
  <li> a small number of third-party packages (numpy, pyfits, others?);
      <p>
  <li> (optional) The following optional packages may be necessary for
      specific functionality in certain environments: 
      <ul>
        <li> pygtk: for certain GUIs (instrument tester, STARS tester, SPOT)
        <li> pyqt: for certain GUIs (guider test gui)
        <li> pytk: for certain GUIs (TelStat)
        <li> perl-tk: for certain GUIs (IntegGUI-Gen2)
        <li> Oracle XE client, cx_Oracle: for accessing existing Subaru
            databases
        <li> others?
      </ul>
</ul>

<a name="inst3">
<h3>Step 3: Subaru SSD software</h3></a>
A Subversion check out of the following SSD repositories:
<ul>
  <li> Required common functionality:
      <pre>
      $ mkdir ~/Svn
      $ cd ~/Svn
      $ svn co -N svn+ssh://ssdsrc/var/svn/repos/lib/trunk lib
      $ cd lib; svn up python
      </pre>
      <p>
  <li> If you want TelStat
      <pre>
      $ cd ~/Svn
      $ svn co -N svn+ssh://ssdsrc/var/svn/repos/ocs/soss/ssd/trunk/product
      $ cd product
      $ svn up OSSO   # also brings in OSSO_AdmUsr*, OSSO_ObcpStat.d, OSSO_TelSummary.d
      $ cd OSSO/OSSO_TelStat.d
      $ ln -s ../../../lib/python gen2lib
      $ ln -s ../../../lib/python/Gen2 gen2src
      </pre>
      <p>
  <li> If you want IntegGUI Gen2
      <pre>
      $ cd ~/Svn
      $ svn co svn+ssh://ssdsrc/var/svn/repos/users/eric/SOSS g2-soss
      </pre>
      <p>
</ul>
<p>
Once you have a check out, "build" the SSD software.  It is mostly
Python, so this mostly creates the proper configuration files. 
<pre>
      $ cd ~/Svn/lib/python
      $ make

<a name="run1">
<h3>Step 1: Booting Gen2</h3></a>
Open a terminal window and issue the following commands:
<pre>
      $ export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/Svn/lib/python  # bash
      $ setenv PYTHONPATH $HOME/Svn/lib/python   # tcsh
      $ cd ~/Svn/lib/python/Gen2
      $ ./BootManager.py --config=solo
</pre>
The <code>--config</code> argument is required and directs the Boot
Manager to initialize itself with the selected running configuration map
out of the <tt>g2config.py</tt> file.
<p>
The following maps are currently defined:
<ul>
  <li> <strong>solo</strong> <br>
      Configured to run everything on one host.  Useful for testing,
      demos, etc.
      Note that you <em>may</em> need to edit the "localhost" entry in your
      <code>/etc/hosts</code> file to add the alias "localhos"--this is
      due to an unfortunate limitation in the SOSS rpc packet format
      that limits hostnames to 8 characters.  Type "hostname" at the
      Unix prompt; if the result is eight characters or less you
      probably don't need to worry about this.
      <p>
  <li> <strong>gen2</strong> <br>
      Configured to run gen2 on the gen2 development cluster.
      <p>
  <li> <strong>ssd</strong> <br>
      Configured to run gen2 on the OCS team developer machines, using
      several hosts in a fake cluster.
      <p>
  <li> <strong>sim</strong> <br>
      Configured to run gen2 on the SOSS simulator machines (mobs, mobc, mdbs
      and mvgw), using them in a fake cluster.  <em><b>Use with care!</b>
      SOSS must be shutdown first</em>.
      <p>
  <li> <strong>summit</strong> <br>
      Configured to run gen2 on the SOSS summit machines (obs, obc, dbs
      and vgw), using them in a fake cluster.  <em><b>Use with care!</b>
      SOSS must be shutdown first</em>.
      <p>
</ul>
<p>
By default, the Boot Manager drops you into a command prompt.  The
command interpreter uses readline, so you have history and standard
command line editing, etc.  Commands take the form of a python method
call, sans the object syntax. 
<p>
You will want to use the following steps to bring up Gen2:
<pre>
      $ ./BootManager.py --config=solo
      bootmgr> start(0)
      check_svc: 1, {('ssd17.subaru.nao.ac.jp', 7070): (0, 99)}
      0
      bootmgr> start(1)
      0
      bootmgr> start(2)
      0
      bootmgr> start(3)
      0
</pre>
<p>
You will want to use the following steps to shut down Gen2:
<pre>
      bootmgr> shutdown()
      {('ssd17.subaru.nao.ac.jp', 7070): (0, 0)}
      bootmgr> ^D
      $ 
</pre>

<h3>Details</h3>
Here is an explanation of the steps, in more detail:
<ol>
  <li>
      <pre>
      bootmgr> start(0)
      </pre>
      This command causes the Boot Manager to start the remote objects
      Manager Service on the nodes defined in the configuration, and to
      send to each Manager Service service definitions from the
      current configuration, as specified with the "--config" option
      and defined in g2config.py.
      Diagnostic log messages to go /tmp/ro_mgrsvc.log, and all output
      to stdout and stderr are redirected into /tmp/ro_mgrsvc_stdout.log.
      The ro_mgrsvc_stdout.log file includes some log messages redirected 
      from server processes started up by the Manager Service.
      The process ID of the Manager Service is stored into /tmp/ro_mgrsvc.pid.
      <p>

  <li>
      <pre>
      bootmgr> start(1)
      </pre>
      This command causes the Boot Manager to start all services that
      are defined at stage 1 in the configuration.  
      This stage contains all "infrastructure" level services.
      Currently this is just the Remote Objects Name Service, 
      which is started on all cluster nodes and records diagnostic 
      messages in the Gen2/Logs/ro_names.log file.  
      <p>
  
  <li>
      <pre>
      bootmgr> start(2)
      </pre>
      Stage 2 defines Gen2 services that are desirable to have up before
      "everything else". Currently just the Boot Manager (server), Session
      Manager and Monitor are started at this stage.  Status might also
      concievably be started at this stage, but currently is not.  This
      stage should be considered a "quiescent" Gen2 system.
      <p>
  
  <li>
      <pre>
      bootmgr> start(3)
      </pre>
      Stage 3 defines all the remaining services, which includes most
      interfaces.  After level 3 is up the system is "hot" and ready for
      operation. 
      <p>
  
</ol>
<p>
After the system is up, the Boot Manager makes it very easy to stop,
start and restart entire stages or selected services.  The following
shows some useful commands:
<ul>
  <li>
      <pre>
      bootmgr> stop("taskmgr")
      bootmgr> start("taskmgr")
      bootmgr> restart("taskmgr")
      </pre>
      Stop, start or restart a selected service.  If a number is given,
      refers to the entire stage.
      <p>
  
  <li>
      <pre>
      bootmgr> uptime([])
      bootmgr> uptime('monitor')
      </pre>
      Shows the uptime for all services and just the monitor, respectively.
      <p>
  
  <li>
      <pre>
      bootmgr> stopall()
      </pre>
      Stops all services in all levels, except for level 0.
      <p>
  
  <li>
      <pre>
      bootmgr> shutdown()
      </pre>
      Like <code>stopall()</code> plus shuts down the Manager Service on
      every node as well. 
      <p>
  
  <li>
      <pre>
      bootmgr> reloadConfig()
      </pre>
      Reload the g2config.py configuration file.  Usually you want to
      follow this by a <code>setup()</code> command to flush any
      configuration changes out to the Manager Service running on all nodes.
      <p>
  
</ul>
<p>
You can quit the Boot Manager shell at any time using Control-D.  Once
the Manager Service, is initialized, Boot Manager shell is generally not
needed except if you want to control services manually from a terminal
window.  (Stage 2 actually starts a detached copy of the Boot Manager
running in "service mode";  this is what is used by the "BM" tab in
IntegGUI-g2, which gives the same basic functionality as the Boot
Manager command prompt). 
<p>
For most configurations, you will find logs written to the "Logs"
subdirectory of .../Gen2/.  
Also of possible interest are the Remote Object Manager Service logs
found in /tmp/ro_mgrsvc.log and /tmp/ro_mgrsvc_stdout.log .

<a name="run2">
<h3>Step 2: Initializing the Frame Server</h3></a>

Do <strong>not</strong> follow this procedure if you plan to use
IntegGUI, which has a Launcher button for doing this.
<p>
To initialize the Frame Server to provide SPCAM frame ID's, starting
at the specified ID, open a terminal window, and run frameSvc.py
as follows:
<pre>
      $ export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/Svn/lib/python  # bash
      $ setenv PYTHONPATH $HOME/Svn/lib/python   # tcsh
      $ cd ~/Svn/lib/python/Gen2
      $ ./frameSvc.py --set SPCAM SUPA80002000
      Frameid reset to 'SUPA80002000'
</pre>


<a name="run3">
<h3>Step 3: Running Tasks from the Task Manager</h3></a>

Do <strong>not</strong> follow this procedure if you plan to use
IntegGUI, which is an alternative way of running tasks.
To run tasks under the Gen2 TaskManager, open a terminal window, and start the
TaskManager remote command line interface:
<pre>
      $ export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/Svn/lib/python  # bash
      $ setenv PYTHONPATH $HOME/Svn/lib/python   # tcsh
      $ cd ~/Svn/lib/python/Gen2
      $ ./TaskManager.py --cmd
      yacc: Warning. no p_error() function is defined.
      taskmgr> !loadModules(['TCS', 'TelTask', 'SPCAM', 'g2eng', 'OBSTask'])
      0
      taskmgr> !setAllocs(['monitor', 'status', 'TCSint0', 'SPCAM', 'sessions', 'frames'])
      0
      taskmgr> !loadParaDirs(['../SkPara/cmd/TSC', '../SkPara/cmd/SPCAM', '../SkPara/cmd/OBS'])
      0
      taskmgr> 
</pre>
These three steps loaded two task modules, manually set the allocation
handles to subsystems and loaded a set of PARA files for type-checking
device-dependent (telescope and instrument) commands.  If these complete
successfully then you are now ready to issue commands.
<p>
You may now execute device dependent commands from the TaskManager
command prompt.  For example:
<pre>
      taskmgr> EXEC TSC AG_PARTS MOTOR=ON SHUTTER=OPEN
      taskmgr> EXEC TSC INSROT_PF MOTOR=ON TELESCOPE=LINK COORD=ABS
</pre>


<h3>Details</h3>
The Task Manager command line interface, like the Boot Manager command 
line interface, has history and command completion.  Python-style method
calls are preceeded by a bang (i.e. exclamation or "!") and these are
used to configure the Task Manager.  Any command not beginning with a
bang is considered to be a SOSS-style task creation command.
<p>
Tasks are defined in files in the gen2/src/Tasks directory, in this case
in TelTask.py and SPCAM.py.  If the task class definition inherits from
g2Task.g2Task, then the task may not have been implemented completely 
enough for the device dependent command to work.  In this case, you
will see an error log message in the gen2/src/Logs/taskmgr.log file;
e.g. "E   S:TaskManager.py,L:448  Error creating task...".
If the command succeeds, this log file will show several information (I)
and debug (D) messages.  The last of these log messages should be
an information message ending in "terminated with result '0'".
<p>
Parameter constraints are defined in .para files, which are in subdirectories
of ../SkPara/cmd, in this case in the TSC and SPCAM subdirectories.
If the parameter checking step fails, you will see error messages
in the taskmgr.log file.
<p>
Other log files of interest are the gen2/src/Logs/monitor.log file
and the gen2/src/Logs/TCSsim.log.  The monitor.log file
will have debug messages for a number of events, including task 
start, ack and end times.  If a device dependent command makes it past
the parameter checking step and is sent to the TCS simulator, then
the TCSsim.log file will record its receipt, acknowledgement and 
completion.


<a name="run4">
<h3>Step 4: Feeding Real Status to Gen2</h3></a>

To create a continuous feed of status data to Gen2,
open a terminal window, and start TCSstatSim.py:
<pre>
      $ cd ~/Svn/lib/python/SOSS/STATint
      $ ./TCSstatSim.py -H obs1 -s 1.0 -l 1.0 -v 2.0 -d $HOME/Svn/gen2/src/def/StatusDecodeTab.def localhost
</pre>
This will pull status data from SOSS on obs1 (every 5-10 seconds), and 
forward it to the Gen2 status module.

<p>
To feed a single full set of status data to Gen2,
replace the TCSstatSim.py command line above with:
<pre>
      $ ./TCSstatSim.py -H obs1 -s -l -v -I -d $HOME/Svn/gen2/src/def/StatusDecodeTab.def localhost
</pre>
This will pull status data from SOSS on obs1 just once, and will 
forward it to the Gen2 status module.

<h3>Details</h3>

TCSstatSim.py accepts a number of options, followed by a single positional
argument, which is the hostname of the system on which the receiving
Gen2 status process is running.
Options that you can give to TCSstatSim.py:
<pre>
  -d &lt;filespec&gt;
             Read status decoding tables from &lt;filespec&gt;.  This file must
             be a Gen2-style decoding table, and defaults to
             'newdef/StatusDecodeTab.def'.
  -F         Send constant data read from files, NOT pulled from -H host.
             (Current version will generate zero- or integer-filled V data
             rather than reading it from files.)
  -H obs1    Host from which to pull TCS data, default to obs1.
             -F and -H are mutually exclusive.  Whichever of these is last
             will determine where data is read from.
  -I         Initialize only.  After a single copy of each category of
             data (specified by -s, -S, -l, -L, -v, -V) is sent, terminate.

  -S ss.s    Period for pulling TCSS data from OBS, default to 5.0 seconds.
  -s ss.s    Period for pushing TCSS data to STATint host, def to 0.1 seconds.
  -S,-s      Without a period value, causes sending with default periods.
             If neither -s nor -S are furnished, no TCSS data will be processed.
  -L ss.s    Period for pulling TCSL data from OBS, default to 5.0 seconds.
  -l ss.s    Period for pushing TCSL data to STATint host, def to 1.0 seconds.
  -L,-l      Without a period value, causes sending with default periods.
             If neither -l nor -L are furnished, no TCSL data will be processed.
  -V ss.s    Period for pulling TCSV data from OBS, default to 10.0 seconds.
  -v ss.s    Period for pushing TCSV data to STATint host, def to 1.0 seconds.
  -V,-v      Without a period value, causes sending with default periods.
             If neither -v nor -V are furnished, no TCSV data will be processed.
  -vl        With no argument, send all SDS's (up to vs size per interval).
  -vs        Send all V SDS's, or all that are in the vl list, each interval.
             [this is the default]
  -vs &lt;size&gt; Send no more than &lt;size&gt; data at each V interval.
  -vz        Send zero data in V packets [this is the default].
  -vi        Send integer data in V packets (0,1,2,...,255,0,1,...).
  -vr        Randomize SDS selection for V packets sent
  -vn        Set SDS's V packets to follow order given in decoding tables
</pre>
Once TCSstatSim.py has started, it gives you a command prompt ("cmd>"),
at which point you can dynamically modify its behavior with any
of the following:
<pre>
    ?,H,h       print this help information
    Q,q,X,x     terminate program

    ds          stop  sending TCSS data
    s           start sending TCSS data at previous or default rate
    s ss.s      start sending TCSS data every ss.s seconds
    S ss.s      specify period for pulling TCSS data from OBS

    dl          stop  sending TCSL data
    l           start sending TCSL data at previous or default rate
    l ss.s      start sending TCSL data every ss.s seconds
    L ss.s      specify period for pulling TCSL data from OBS

    dv          stop  sending TCSV data
    v           start sending TCSV data at previous or default rate
    v ss.s      start sending TCSV data every ss.s seconds
    V ss.s      specify period for pulling TCSV data from OBS
    vs &lt;size&gt;   send no more than &lt;size&gt; data at each V interval
    vs          send all V SDS's, or all that are in the vl list, each interval
    vz          send zero data in V packets
    vi          send integer data in V packets (0,1,2,...,255,0,1,...)
    vl          with no argument, send all SDS's (up to vs size per interval)
    vr          randomize SDS selection for V packets sent
    vn          set SDS's V packets to follow order given in decoding tables

    S ss.s      specify period for pulling TCSS data from OBS
    L ss.s      specify period for pulling TCSL data from OBS
    V ss.s      specify period for pulling TCSV data from OBS
</pre>


<a name="run5">
<h3>Step 5: Running TelStat</h3></a>
To run TelStat,open a terminal window, and start OSSO_TelStat:
<pre>
      $ cd ~/Svn/product/OSSO/OSSO_TelStat.d
      $ setenv PYTHONPATH OSSO_TelStatLib:$PYTHONPATH
      $ ./OSSO_TelStat -d -g2 -l
</pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

TelStat will place log files in the directory from which you run it
(unless you are running under SOSS!).  You should check these files,
or at least delete them, from time to time, especially if you use
the "-l" option -- they can become rather large.

<p>
Options that you can give to OSSO_TelStat:
<pre>
  -l                Run TelStat with data logging turned on; this will
  -logdata          produce a file named 'TelStat_ReplayData_&lt;timetag&gt;.log'
                    in the current directory, containing all of the 
                    status alias values used by TelStat until either the
                    end of the run or until logging is turned off with
                    the Options menu.

  -d                Run TelStat with debug menu turned on.
  -debug

  -s                Run TelStat in local simulation mode for debugging.
  -sim

  -g2               Run TelStat in OCS Gen 2 mode, pulling status data
  -gen2             from a Gen 2 status.py server.  If not specified,
                    TelStat is run in SOSS mode, using OSSC_screenPrint
                    calls to pull status data from OBS.

  -r &lt;logSpec&gt;      Run TelStat to replay a data log created by the -l 
  -replay &lt;logSpec&gt; option.  This also turns debugging mode on, to
                    allow control of the playback.

  -i &lt;n&gt;            When -r is specified, -i &lt;n&gt; will skip the first
  -initskip &lt;n&gt;     n records before starting the replay.  If the replay
                    session is restarted (by selecting 
                    Options/Restart Data Replay), TelStat will again
                    skip the first n records, thus restarting at the
                    same record as initially requested.

  -n                Initialize TelStat to do no data updates
  -norefresh        (this only makes sense if debugging is turned on, 
                    so this does nothing if -d was not specified).

<h3>Step 6: Running IntegGUI</h3></a>
<p>
Do <strong>not</strong> follow this procedure if you plan to use the 
TaskManager directly, which is an alternative way of running tasks.
Do, however, boot Gen2, as described under 
<strong><a href="#run1">Step 1</a></strong>, above.

<p>
To run tasks under the IntegGUI, open a terminal window, and start the
TaskManager remote command line interface:
<pre>
      $ export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/Svn/lib/python  # bash
      $ setenv PYTHONPATH $HOME/Svn/lib/python   # tcsh
      $ cd ~/Svn/g2-soss/product/load
      $ IntegGUI.py         # . must be in your path
</pre>

This will display one error message and a variety of information and warning
messages, which may be ignored.
IntegGUI may be started at any time after the BootManager start(0) command
has completed.

<p>
To display the IntegGUI log file, open another teriminal window and:
<pre>
      $ cd ~/Svn/g2-soss/product/load
      $ tail -f OSSO_ObsOpe.log
</pre>

<p>
<strong>Command Launcher commands to issue:</strong>

<p>
<strong>SM</strong> tab:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reset Frame Counter</strong> -- In the boxes, enter
        "SPCAM" and "SUPA80000000" (or whatever combination of instrument
        name and starting frame ID).  This allows Gen2 applications to
        request frame ID's from the FrameServer for the specified instrument.
        This performs the same function as
        <strong><a href="#run2">Step 2</a></strong>, above, so there is
        no need to do both.
    <li><strong>Allocate</strong> -- Select SPCAM from the drop-down menu
        (or other instrument, as appropriate).
    <li><strong>Change Proposal</strong> -- Fill in the boxes for Prop-ID,
        Observers, Support Scientist and Operator, before clicking on the
        button.  These strings go into status alias values, and are used
        in FITS headers for images captured.
</ul>

<p>
<strong>TM</strong> tab:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Load Modules</strong> -- For SuprimeCam, enter
        "TelTask SPCAM g2eng" in the box, before clicking on the button.
    <li><strong>Load PARA Dirs</strong> -- For SuprimeCam, enter
        "TCS OBS SPCAM" in the box, before clicking on the button.
</ul>
