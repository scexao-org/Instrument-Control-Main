Gen2 TODO
---------
Key: F--Finished, I--In progress, P--Partially implemented/working
     W--Workaround

FRONT ENDS
==========

Integgui2
---------
[ ] Frames not sorted in IntegGUI Obs Journal; mostly affects SPCAM
[ ] Bug causing crash when loading FITS files during lots of activity
[ ] Occasional crashing--log error message indicates something in GTK toolkit?
[ ] Preserve history for observation journal and command history across
      restarts

Fits Viewer
-----------
[I] Achieve feature parity and reasonable speed compared to old fits viewer
[ ] Preserve history across restarts

skTask viewer
-------------
[ ] Need to add events that happen at the sub-DD command level

TelStat
-------
[D] change to monitor subscription style for processing status
[ ] Fix uptime stability
[ ] Make sure lamp display is showing the proper status

EnvMonitor
----------
[D] change to monitor subscription style for processing status
[ ] need to save pickle file at some interval, but throw away old, old data
[ ] look into using RRD files

hskymon
-------
[ ] Occasionally still crashing

Web interface
-------------
[ ] Bogus TSRs cause problems--put in some more error checking
[ ] Show integgui-style frame summary 

Misc
----
[P] Allow change of displays for GUI applications

BACK ENDS
=========

Task Manager
------------
[ ] Error messages can be improved
[ ] When failing to initialize by loading bad tasks, etc. during
    initializeFromSession the TM does not cleanly show the errors

SOSS Compatibility
------------------
[ ] @user register seems to be used by some PARA files--but not implemented
      (e.g. EXEC SPCAM CAMERA  and EXEC SPCAM T1)
    However, these don't seem to be used in any skeletons
[ ] Check whether any TSC PARA files need to be updated for change in cal
     lamps
[ ] QDAS frames are being saved with world write permission--just umask issue?

Databases
---------
[ ] QDASvgwStarList.py hard codes the host name

TSC interface
-------------
[ ] Check if there is a speed difference logging in as "OBS"
[ ] Why do some agsh_probe_local(_pf) commands take longer in Gen2
[ ] Test speed vs. SOSS at different foci

STARS interface
---------------
[ ] Need "plan B"

Frame Service
-------------
[ ] Needs to be upgraded to Postgres
[ ] Be able to dynamically toggle pulling frames from SOSS

ANA functions
-------------
[D] Have TelStat button bring up TelStat
[ ] Check if we need to bypass "empty" Q frames (COMICS)
[ ] Do we need an EXEC ANA CHECK_FRAME command? (MOIRCS)

Periodic commands
-----------------
[ ] Frame check
[ ] Automatic pruning of FITS files?
[ ] Automatic archival of logs
[ ] ut1-utc upgrade--how to make it automatic?
[ ] tomorrow-2am file

Middleware
----------
[ ] Consider having remoteObjectManager use PubSub to distribute uptime 
    info instead of polling this information using BootManager
[ ] Should PubSub have a security layer (allow only certain subscriptions)
[ ] Should datasink transactions be reported via the monitor?
[ ] PubSub/Monitor may need ORDERED and TWOWAY options implemented?

Logs
----
[ ] Log-cutting function is stripping out non-log formatted lines
[P] Need to change Gen2 configuration to allow log files to rotate (mostly done--need to do a couple more)


System Admin
------------
[ ] Order front end workstations
[ ] Order remote workstations
[ ] Finish reclaiming disk space at summit and base
[ ] Get simulator moved off of base RAID 6
[ ] Implement power shutdown
[ ] Implement better monitoring via Shinken
[ ] Implement better monitoring via STS
[ ] Backups using LVM snapshots
[ ] Establish procedure using LVM snapshots for system patching/upgrading
[ ] Add summit, remote and OCS room printers to Gen2
[ ] Should GUIs and VNC sessions run as a different user from Gen2?

Training and Precheck
---------------------

Documentation
-------------
* always need more

By instrument
=============
VGW
---
[ ] Need to update vignette map to reflect removal of AO36 layer at CS
[ ] Upgrade to skycat 3.0.x and tcl 8.4.x

FLDMON
------
[ ] Need to make default not to show FLDMON frames in FITS viewers 
[ ] How about IntegGUI?

SPCAM
-----
[ ] working well, except for performance of certain TSC commands using PF

HDS
---
* working well

COMICS
------
* working well

IRCS
----
[ ] occasional restart of portmapper needed (FITS transfer RPC registration issue?)

AO188
-----
* working well

WAVEPLAT
--------
* working well

MOIRCS
------
* working well

FOCAS
-----
* working well

FMOS
----
* working well
[F] There is an issue with the frames database due to the way FMOS allocates
      frames

HICIAO
------
* working well

K3D
---
* working well

HSC
---
[ ] Need to finish adding to the back ends
[ ] Need to finish adding to the GUIs
[ ] Document the process
[ ] Try to increase sharing

Long Term
---------
[ ] Rewrite most DD commands to be more efficient, starting with telescope commands (no PARA file processing)
[ ] Deprecate all SOSS QDAS code
[ ] Need to add HSC instrument and document the process
[ ] New Observation Proposal Tool and possibly Observing Tool
[ ] Deprecate old fits viewer when new one is good enough
[ ] Deprecate VGW subsystem when we have a guider interface replacement
[ ] Refactor or rewrite TelStat
[ ] Deprecate old IntegGUI
[ ] Deprecate Instrument Monitor when there is a reasonable replacement
