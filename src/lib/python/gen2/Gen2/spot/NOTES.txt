OLD TODO FROM GARBODEN, BON:
"scp" it to the summit (in two steps) (need an associated oAcct)

Missing features:
update the user stories!

++Output a target list ope file for use by skymonitor

+make ope file directly in python

lots of testing needed (especially GUI)
we need logging, lots of logging!

spot format NOT in python (e.g. XML)

+import a target list (e.g. name, ra, dec, equinox, comment)

add activity sequences!!
general refactoring
recent files dialog
show division in columnar tables
why is the dither list grey and the other lists white?  should be grey
A tool tip-esque work flow hint (creat a target or recipe)

? convert to tabs
Start conversations about two more instruments (HDS->hoe, ircs? SpCam?)
deployment (i.e. install/freeze and multiple platforms, iso)

"editing" functions (e.g. undo, cut, copy, paste, new)
-support undo  (related to unsaved work)
check if there is unsaved work before quiting, opening, newing.
-make graph (including color highlights and minor rounding errors)
more validation

auto checkpoint (i.e. autosave .bak file)
-more work on activity status
-hook up all comments or grey them out
hide second spc button row if unneeded (does strange things to the spacing)
-print plan human readable (xml -> html)
move some buttons around!!
try uniform on hbox (didn't work)
swap activity status and comment
-hook up pane minimize/maximize or disable them
need status bar/ message window

add a new instrument or two (pattern)

allow multiple GUI's
