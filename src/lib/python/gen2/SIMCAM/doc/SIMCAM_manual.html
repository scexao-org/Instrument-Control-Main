<h2>Audience</h2>
</a>
This document addresses an audience of software developers interested in
writing software for interfacing an observation instrument to Subaru
Telescope's Observation Control System (OCS).  Some basic understanding of
software development principles as well as a general familiarity with
observatory infrastructures is assumed.

<a name="about">
<h2>About</h2>
</a>
Subaru Telescope's distributed control system is based on four
fundamental subsystems:
<ol>
  <li> There is the <em>Telescope Control System</em> which controls the
      basic movements of the telescope and its mechanical components, as
      well as those of the dome, etc.</li>
      <p>
  <li> There is the <em>Instrument Control System</em>, which
      encompasses all of the computer control components of an
      instrument.</li>
      <p>
  <li> There is the data archive system, known as STARS (<em>Subaru
      Telescope ARchive System</em>).</li>
      <p>
  <li> At the center of these systems is the <em>Observation Control
      System</em>, which interfaces to the three systems referred to
      above, as well as providing the human interfaces to the operators
      and observers.  Subaru's OCS is known as "Gen2" (so called because
      it is the second generation OCS for Subaru).</li>
      <p>
</ol>
At Subaru, the interface between the instrument control system and the
observation control system is handled by a top-level computer referred
to as the <em>OBCP</em> (OBservation Control Processor).  The OBCP is
typically a Unix/Linux-based system that is the locus for commands,
status, and data files transferred between the two systems.  This is
illustrated by Figure 1.
<p>
Figure 1. Subaru Telescope Subsystem Overview (figure courtesy Scot
Kleinman) <br>
<img src="OCS_schematic.png" align="bottom" hspace="20" vspace="20">
<br clear="all">

<p>
On the right-hand side of this figure, you can see the OBCP and its
interfaces with the OCS.  This interface encompasses four basic "channels":
<ol>
  <li> Commands to the instrument from the OCS and the instrument's
      responses; 
      <p>
  <li> Requests for external status data from the instrument to the OCS
      and the OCS's replies with that requested status.
      <p>
  <li> Transfers of internal status data of interest from the instrument
      to the OCS, and
      <p>
  <li> Requests for transfers of data files created by the instrument to
      the OCS, and the OCS's replies about the results of transferring
      the files.  All files transferred from the instrument are
      automatically archived from the OCS via STARS.
      <p>
</ol>

<b>SIMCAM</b><h2>SIMCAM</h2>
SIMCAM is a object-oriented software framework, written in Python, for
interfacing top-level instrument control systems to Subaru Telescope's
Observation Control System.  As shown in the diagram in Figure 1, SIMCAM
implements and abstracts the low level interfaces used for commands to,
status transfer to and from, and file transfer from, the instrument's
top level computer, or "OBCP".
Using this framework, developers can write multi-threaded applications
to interface with the OCS with a quite high level of abstraction.  The
top-level SIMCAM module can be written to interface with instrument's
own internal subsystems in a variety of ways, including Python classes
and functions, embedded C code, FIFOs, sockets, files, shared memory, etc.
<p>

<a name="SIMCAM_API">
<h2>The SIMCAM API</h2>
</a>
To interface with the SIMCAM framework, a Python module is created which
defines at least one class inheriting from the BASECAM class.  This
inheritance provides the class with some abstract superclass methods
and attributes that will normally be overridden by the subclass.
<pre class="code">
#
# My new instrument
#
from SIMCAM import BASECAM, CamError, CamCommandError
...

class MYCAM(BASECAM):

    ....
</pre>
There are several example modules included for real instruments that are
used at Subaru.  Examining these example modules you will see what
arguments are necessary for the class constructor (also described in the
section below <a href="#initialization">Putting it all together: the
SIMCAM cam</a>). 
For methods defined inside the class there are a number of useful
convenience methods for logging, running concurrent tasks and
interacting with the OCS.  

<a name="commands">
<h3>Command processing</h3>
</a>
Command processing in the SIMCAM framework is based on an event-driven
callback model that will be familiar to most developers.  By simply
defining non-private methods in the class, those functions immediately
become available commands to the OCS.  For example
<pre class="code">
class MYCAM(BASECAM):
    ...
    ...
    #######################################
    # INSTRUMENT COMMANDS
    #######################################

    def snap(self, frameid=None, itime=10.0):

        self.logger.debug("snap called.")
        ...
        ...

</pre>
Defines a new instrument <code>MYCAM</code> that contains an
invocable command called <code>snap</code> (presumably some kind of exposure
command), with parameters <code>frameid</code> and <code>itime</code>.  From
the OCS side, commands are case-insensitive, so the command might be
invoked as snap, SNAP, Snap, sNAp, etc.  On the Python side the method name
should be defined in lower case. 
<p>
Parameters should be defined as Python keyword arguments, with default
values that will be assigned if they are not supplied at the time of
invocation.
<p>
The command does whatever it needs to do (calling other methods, etc).
There are several possible scenarios for command completion:
<ol>
  <li> The method raises a generic exception.  In this case it will be caught
      and reported as a command completion with error to the OCS (using
      the exception error string).  A traceback is also logged.
      <p>
  <li> The method raises a <code>CamCommandError</code> exception (or a
      subclass thereof).  This is the preferred way of signaling an
      error.  An error is reported to the OCS using the exception string
      and no traceback is logged.
      <p>
  <li> The method returns normally and the result is an int or a tuple
      of (int, str).  In this case, the integer is interpreted as a
      return code: 0 is success, and non-zero is an error.  In the tuple
      form, the string provides a diagnostic of success or failure
      message.
      <p>
  <li> The method returns normally, but the result is not an int or a
      tuple of (int, str).  In this case, the command is assumed to have
      completed successfully, and a success code and generic diagnostic
      is returned to the OCS.  If a Python method exits a method by
      "falling off the end" (i.e. no <code>return</code> statement), the
      return code is <code>None</code>.  That covers this case.
      <p>
</ol>
<p>
Note that since the framework is multi-threaded, executing a command does not
prevent other commands from being received and processed.  Although the 
API methods of the SIMCAM framework are thread-safe, it is up to the
developer to make sure that shared instance state in the subclass is
protected via standard thread-safety techniques such as semaphores,
locks, condition variables, etc. 
The <code>threading</code> and <code>Queue</code> packages in the
standard Python library provides many useful classes for this purpose.
<p>
Although commands are typically driven from the OCS side, an instrument 
can set up it's own autonomous command invocations.  The SIMCAM framework
includes a thread pool and some common methods for executing a method or
function on it (see section below "Creating concurrent tasks").
Alternatively you may choose to create and invoke threads
using the Python <code>threading</code> library directly.  Either way, a method
can be spawned off into an independent self-timed loop for handling periodic
tasks.
<p>
Since Python is a dynamic, interpreted language, the turnaround time for 
developing and debugging new commands is very fast.  Simply add new methods
to the module in an editor and restart simcam.

<a name="getting_status">
<h3>Requesting external status</h3>
</a>
Although commands are typically initiated from the OCS side, requests for 
status values are initiated from the instrument side.  A typical example is
when taking an exposure, the instrument needs the telescope pointing values
for RA and DEC before and after the exposure for the purpose of creating 
a FITS file.
<p>
The SIMCAM framework provides a method in a delegate object for fetching
external status values.  Let's enhance our <code>snap</code> method to
illustrates how it is used:
<pre class="code">
    def snap(self, frameid=None, itime=10.0):
	"""
        A command to open the shutter of the camera and begin exposure.
        """
        ...
        
        # Create a dictionary, whose keys are status aliases we want
	statusDict = {'STATS.RA': None, 'STATS.DEC': None}

        try:
            self.ocs.requestOCSstatus(statusDict)

        except CamError, e:
            # Some kind of error occurred--bail out
            raise CamCommandError("Failed to obtain status: %s" % str(e))

        # Successful call, get values
        ra, dec = (statusDict['STATS.RA'], statusDict['STATS.DEC'])
        self.logger.debug("ra=%s, dec=%s" % (ra, dec))

        # Do other snap stuff...
        ...
        ...

</pre>
There are a couple of things to note about this example.  One is the use
of the logging facility.  If the run-time logging level is set to
include debug, then the information about the ra and dec will be logged.
The second is the use of Exceptions to catch and signal errors.  Note
that the call to 
<code>requestOCSstatus()</code> is wrapped in a <code>try/except</code>
clause, and that we re-raise the error as a <code>CamCommandError</code>
if we run into trouble.  We could also simply return an error code, or
an error code and message, as described in the section on <a
href="#commands">command processing</a>.  Thirdly, note how we create
a dictionary with the keys of the OCS status items for which we want
values.  These keys are called <em>status aliases</em>.  There are
hundreds upon hundreds of them.  Someday hopefully we will have a manual
to describe them all.  Until then, your best bet is to examine the code
in the example cam modules or ask a member of the Subaru OCS software
team or a Subaru support scientist what the aliases are for 
the status values you need, and what the type of those values are.
<p>
The call to <code>self.ocs.requestOCSstatus()</code> fills in the dictionary
with the values fetched from the OCS.  The values are given the appropriate
type for the kind of status that they are (float, int, string, etc.).
In this case, the STATS.RA and STATS.DEC values are defined as string
values in the OCS, which is why they are returned as such.
Of course, convenience methods could be defined for fetching different sets
of commonly needed status items and massaging them as appropriate.
<p>
We should point out that in many cases, an attempt to fetch a valid status
alias that has no currently defined value (or even an invalid status alias)
may not raise an exception.  Instead, that particular dictionary element will
have an error value in it, and the whole status call will succeed, because
the OCS system returns these error values without signaling an overall error
to the low level interface.  These individual errors may be checked for
by comparing the values with the following method (compare to above):
<pre class="code">
    def snap(self, frameid=None, itime=10.0):
	"""
        ...
        ...

        try:
            self.ocs.requestOCSstatus(statusDict)

        except CamError, e:
            # Some kind of error occurred--bail out
            raise CamCommandError("Failed to obtain status: %s" % str(e))

        results = self.ocs.validateStatus(statusDict)
        if len(results) > 0:
            self.logger.error("Values are invalid for: %s" % str(results))
            for alias in results:
            ...
            ...
        ...
        ...
</pre>
The code could then examine the particular aliases to see if it is
possible to proceed without them.

<a name="sending_status">
<h3>Distributing instrument status</h3>
</a>
Instruments may want to distribute internal status that may be of interest
to external parties.  In particular, if the skeleton files or observation
plan files need to conditionally do something based on the state of the 
instrument, this is usually handled by examining the most recent status that
was sent by the instrument.  Like status requests, status distribution is 
initiated by the instrument side, and not the OCS.  Status may be distributed
at any time by the instrument, and the OCS system will absorb it, process
it and make it available through the OCS status system.

<a name="internal_status_initialization">
<h3>Setting up instrument status tables</h3>
</a>
Status distribution is a little more complicated than status requests due
to the way that status is currently handled in the OCS system
(by tables that are essentially packed buffers).  This underlying buffer
interface was unfortunately exposed to the API in the first generation OCS,
which required instruments to pack their own status buffers, and exposed the
concept of separate status tables.  This internal representation may change in
Gen2.  Currently, the interface requires a little bit of boilerplate
code to set up the linkage between the SIMCAM status values and what is
expected on the OCS side.

<pre class="code">
    #######################################
    # INITIALIZATION
    #######################################

    def initialize(self, ocsint):
        super(SIMCAM, self).initialize(ocsint)

        self.logger.info("initialize() called")

        # Grab my handle to the OCS interface.
        self.ocs = ocsint

        # Get instrument configuration info
        self.obcpnum = self.ocs.get_obcpnum()
        self.insconfig = self.ocs.get_INSconfig()

        ...
        ...

        # Get our 3 letter instrument code and full instrument name
        self.inscode = self.insconfig.getCodeByNumber(self.obcpnum)
        self.insname = self.insconfig.getNameByNumber(self.obcpnum)
        
        self.statusTblName = ('%3.3sS0001' % self.inscode)

        # Used to format status buffer (item lengths must match definitions
        # of status aliases on OCS side in .../StatusAlias.pro)
        statfmt = "%(status)-8.8s,%(mode)-8.8s,%(count)8d;"

        # Register my status.
        self.mystatus = self.ocs.addStatusTable(self.statusTblName,
                                                ['status', 'mode', 'count',
                                                 'last_frame'],
                                                formatStr=statfmt)
        
        ...
        ...
</pre>
This code example shows the <code>initialize</code> method, which is part
of the standard boilerplate code used in initializing the instrument module
(see <a href="#initialization">Putting it all together: the SIMCAM
cam</a>). When called, the parameter <code>ocsint</code> is a handle to
the OCS interface delegate object. 
After calling the superclass constructor, the method stores this away in its
internal state in the variable <code>ocs</code> (you encountered this variable
in earlier examples, now you see where it came from). 
<p>
Using that handle, the initialize method can now invoke delegate calls to 
the interface to accomplish various things.  First, it finds out it's own
OBCP number (all Subaru instruments are enumerated), followed by it's code 
(official 3-letter acronym) and full name (canonical name).
<p>
It then constructs a table name (which must exist on the OCS side; the 
example shows the canonical table name for an instrument), a table
format (a format string describing 
how to pack the status values into the buffer) and then makes a call to
<code>addStatusTable()</code> to create a table, containing the listed 
status elements, and connecting it to the format string.

<a name="internal_status_usage">
<h3>Getting and setting internal status</h3>
</a>
Beyond the boilerplate code, status values can be set any time, anywhere
in the module by simply assigning the values to the status table object
(you can also create multiple table objects) in dictionary style, or using
any of several convenience methods:
<pre class="code">
        ...
        # dictionary style interface...
        self.mystatus['status'] = 'ALIVE'
        self.mystatus['last_frame'] = ''

        # Convenience method, with keyword arguments:
        self.mystatus.setvals(status='ALIVE', last_frame='')
        ...
        # Convenience method, with dictionary:
	statusDict = {'status': 'ALIVE', 'last_frame': ''}
        self.mystatus.store(statusDict)
        ...
</pre>
The advantage of using the convenience functions is that it ensures that all
the listed status items are updated together, and not intermixed if
another thread is also updating, or reading, status.
<p>
Similarly, to read your own (instrument) status, you can either access
the items dictionary style, or use convenience methods:
<pre class="code">
        ...
        # dictionary style interface...
        last_frame = self.mystatus['last_frame']

        # Multiple items can be fetched, atomically as a group
        (status, last_frame) = self.mystatus.fetchList(['status',
                                                        'last_frame'])

        # Or you can use a dict, to get them as a group
	statusDict = {'status': None, 'last_frame': None}
        self.mystatus.fetch(statusDict)
        ...
</pre>
Again, using the convenience methods insures that all the status items are
fetched as a group, atomically.  The goal here is to abstract as much as
possible the OCS internal representation of status.  For Gen2, it is
likely that the old status interface will be retained for some time.
However, using this abstraction 
means that only the boilerplate code in <code>initialize</code> will
likely need to be changed for an all new Gen2 status interface.

<a name="internal_status_usage">
<h3>Transmitting internal status</h3>
</a>
Status is not transmitted (distributed) until an explicit call is made to
do so.  You might define a method to export the status like so: 
<pre class="code">
    def putstatus(self, tableName="ALL"):
        """Export of our status.
        """
        if tableName == 'ALL':
            res = self.ocs.exportStatus()

        else:
            res = self.ocs.exportStatusTable(tableName)

	return res
</pre>
The <code>exportStatus</code> and <code>exportStatusTable</code>
delegate methods cause the current status table objects (all objects or
a specific one, respectively) to be collapsed into buffers according to
the buffer format string and transmitted to the OCS. 
The <code>putstatus</code> method then becomes a convenience function for
the class, that can be called from anywhere to push out status, as well as a
command that can be invoked from the OCS side to test status transfers.
<p>
We are now in a position to modify our snap method to send some status
that indicates the last frame saved:
<pre class="code">
    def snap(self, frameid=None, itime=10.0):

        ...
        ...

        # Do other snap stuff...
        ...

        # Assuming command was successful:
        self.mystatus.setvals(last_frame=frameid)
        self.putstatus()
</pre>

<a name="archiving">
<h3>Archiving files</h3>
</a>
When an instrument has a FITS file to archive, it uses the fourth interface
provided by the framework.  This action is also initiated from the instrument
side by a <em>file transfer request</em>.  The OCS responds by trying to
transfer the file (currently using FTP as the protocol) and then responding
with a success or error to the instrument.  The following convenience function
illustrates the necessary call: 
<pre class="code">
    def archive_data_file(self, frameid, fitspath):

        self.logger.info("Archiving FITS file '%s' to the OCS" % frameid)

        self.ocs.archive_frame(frameid, fitspath)

        # If no exceptions raised, then we end up here.  Update status
        # to indicate last frame saved
        self.mystatus.setvals(last_frame=frameid)
        self.putstatus()
</pre>
As you can see the <code>self.ocs.archive_frame()</code> call takes a
frame id (like 'SUKA00048245') and the path to the FITS file.  The FITS
file does not need to have the name be the frameid.  The call will
send a file transfer request to the OCS to ask it to copy the file,
renaming it on the other end as the frame id.
<p>
Note that in order for the OCS to transfer the files, an FTP service
should be configured and running on the OBCP.  There are several good
open-source FTP servers such as 'vsftp'.  Pick any one.
<p>
We are now in a position to modify our snap method to archive the file:
<pre class="code">
    def snap(self, frameid=None, itime=10.0):
        ...
        ...

        # Do other snap stuff...
        fitspath = ...

        # Create fits file...
        ...
        self.archive_data_file(frameid, fitspath)
</pre>

<a name="frames">
<h3>Frame Ids</h3>
</a>
You may be wondering what the frame id (frameid, AKA "frame number") is,
and how they are generated.  If you look back to the <code>snap</code>
examples, you can see that the frameid was passed in to that command.
This is the prototypical way that instruments operate at Subaru: FITS
files to be archived are only created at the behest of a OCS initiated
command, and such commands will be designed to take the frame id or
an initial frame id and a count (in the case of generating multiple
files).
<p>
In the rare case that your instrument needs to autonomously allocate a
frame id and archive a file, you can use the <code>getFrame()</code>
method to allocate a frame.  The following example shows how this would
be done:
<pre class="code">
        ...
        ...

        # get a frame id
        frameid = self.getFrame('A')

        # Create fits file...
        fitspath = ...
        ...

        self.archive_data_file(frameid, fitspath)
</pre>
<p>
'A' frames are raw science frames.  'Q' frames are processed science
frames.  You should use either 'A' or 'Q' according to the kind of data
to be archived.

<a name="tasks">
<h3>Creating concurrent tasks</h3>
</a>
For many commands, the control flow would work out something like this:
<ol>
  <li> Command is received from the OCS side, calls the developer's method
       (e.g. snap, with parameters frameid and itime).
       <p>
  <li> Instrument requests and receives status from the OCS, if needed.
       <p>
  <li> Instrument does the command, possibly generating FITS files or status
       to be sent in the process.  It uses the respective APIs to send status
       and or files to be archived.
       <p>
  <li> Command finishes, via one of the appropriate ways outlined earlier.
       <p>
</ol>
Sometimes, this is not the flow of control that you want.  For example, you
may want to have an asyncronous command that validates its parameters and then 
exits quickly, but which initiates continued processing on the instrument
side that entails further processing.  This is often done for long-running
commands.  For example, suppose we want a version of snap() that returns
immediately, but initiates an exposure operation on the instrument.  Later, 
the instrument will finish the snap as previously described and send the
finished fits files and update the status value to
indicate completion of the command.  Let's see how we might do that.
<pre class="code">
import SIMCAM.cams.common as common
    ...
    ...
    def snap_async(self, frameid=None, itime=30.0):
        """Snap command that returns immediately, then later finishes
        asynchronously.
        """

        self.logger.info("long_snap called...")

	if not frameid:
	    raise CamCommandError("No frame number passed!")

        self.logger.info("Starting concurrent task")
        t = common.FuncTask(self.snap, (), frameid=frameid,
                                           itime=itime)
        t.init_and_start(self)
</pre>
This command creates a generic function-calling <em>task</em> that will
call the method <code>snap</code> with no positional arguments and
the exact same keyword arguments that it was called with.  Then it 
initializes and starts the task.  The function will be called by another
thread in the framework's thread pool, leaving this thread to exit the
current command.

<p>
The general problem with this sort of approach is the same as for any 
asynchronous command: what to do if the command fails.  The initial
command completed with success, but how do you track the result of the
asynchronous part?  Typically this would be handled via status value
notification.  Alternatively, another way that this can be handled is to
have a 2-phase command.  For 
example, <code>snap()</code> may initiate an exposure and return immediately.
A second command (e.g. <code>readout</code>) is sent later by the OCS
to read out the CCD, create the FITS files and archive them.

<p>
There are a few common enough tasks that they have been added as a
module of common task code that can be used by any SIMCAM instrument.
We'll go over two such examples.

<a name="power_outage">
<h4>Handling Power Failure</h3>
</a>
The Subaru summit is covered by an extensive UPS system, which is
designed to protect instruments against power variability.  One of the
requirements of OBCPs is that they monitor the power situation and shut
down in a timely and orderly fashion when there is a summit power
outage.  The SIMCAM framework provides a task for monitoring the power
and calling a method <code>powerOff()</code> if the power ever goes
down.  Assuming that you implement that method, then it suffices to
start up the monitoring task when your instrument comes up, and stop it
when it goes down:
<pre class="code">
    def start(self, wait=True):
        super(MYCAM, self).start()
        ...
        ...

        # Start task to monitor summit power
        t = common.PowerCheckTask(self, self.powerOff, self.powerOn,
                                  interval=10.0)
        self.power_task = t
        t.init_and_start(self)
        ...
        ...

    def stop(self, wait=True):
        super(MYCAM, self).stop()
        
        ...
        ...
        # Terminate power checking task
        if self.power_task != None:
            self.power_task.stop()

        self.power_task = None

        ...
        ...
</pre>
This code illustrates two more methods of interest.  <code>start</code>
is called after <code>initialize</code>, and should contain whatever
code you need to "start" your instrument.  <code>stop</code> is called
when the instrument is to be stopped (but not terminated).  You might
then write your <code>powerOff</code> method as:
<pre class="code">
    def powerOff(self):
        """
        This method is called when the summit begins to run on UPS
        power.  Effect an orderly shutdown.
        """
        ...
        ...
        
        self.stop()

        res = os.system('/usr/sbin/shutdown -h 60')

        self.ocs.shutdown(res)
</pre>
Here <code>stop()</code> calls your method to stop the things your
instrument needs to, and <code>shutdown</code> tells the SIMCAM
framework you wish to terminate the program with an exit code of
whatever the system <code>shutdown</code> command returned.
<p>
<a name="periodic_status">
<h4>Sending Periodic Status</h3>
</a>
Our second example is used to illustrate the sending of periodic
status.  The Subaru OCS likes to receive periodic status updates from
the instrument as a kind of heartbeat, to indicate that the instrument
is up and running.  The exact interval is not that important, and
instruments use anything from 5 seconds to 5 minutes.  A reasonable
interval might be 60 seconds.  Assuming you have defined a
<code>putstatus</code> method as described earlier, you can effect that
simply by invoking the common task:
<pre class="code">
    def start(self, wait=True):
        ...
        ...
        # Start task to periodically send status
        t = common.IntervalTask(self.putstatus, 60.0)
        self.status_task = t
        t.init_and_start(self)
</pre>
The <code>IntervalTask</code> simply runs the given function at the
given intervals.  Stopping it is similar to the power monitoring example.

bottom:

<h2>Running SIMCAM</h2>
</a>
There is a simple wrapper program called <code>simcam.py</code> that
provides the appropriate environment for running a SIMCAM module.  A
typical invocation of this program to start the instrument might be as
follows:
<pre class="code">
$ ./simcam.py --cam=MYCAM --loglevel=0 --log=mycam.log --stderr \
--paradir=../SkPara/cmd/MYCAM 
</pre>
This says to start up the instrument with the log directed to the file
"mycam.log", an additional copy of the logging directed to stderr, and
the logging level set to 0 (log everything).  The PARA files will be
loaded from the path <code>../SkPara/cmd/MYCAM</code>.
<p>
Invoking the program with the <code>--help</code> option will list all
options and their usage.

<a name="SOSS_considerations">
<h2>Appendix A: Considerations for SOSS Compatibility Mode</h2>
</a>
<b>SOSS Compatibility Mode</b> is a mode of operation of Gen2 that
maintains a level of backward compatibility for legacy observation
scripts written for <b>SOSS</b>, Subaru's first OCS.  This section
describes some considerations for developing observations that are
compatible with either Gen2 or SOSS.

<h3>Abstract commands</h3>
Subaru operators and observers prepare observation plans as <em>OPE</em>
files.  These are essentially command scripts with command line
invocations--it looks much like a batch script, but without any control
constructs other than a sequential flow of commands.  Observation
proceeds by highlighting the commands to be executed in a GUI and
pressing an execute button.
These commands are either <em>abstract</em> (high-level) commands
or <em>device dependent</em> (low level) commands.  Device-dependent
commands are commands that are issued to one of the subsystems (such as
those described above): telescope, instrument, etc.  Abstract commands
are essentially macros which undergo an expansion process known as
<em>decoding</em>.
<p>
Abstract commands are written using a macro template language and the
templates are stored as <em>skeleton</em> files.  The macro language
includes some primitive control structures that implement the equivalent
of iteration, subroutine calls, etc.    
Ultimately, the processing of skeleton files devolves into sequential or
concurrent issuance of device dependent commands to one of the
distributed subsystems.  In this manner, potentially complex 
patterns of interdependent distributed command execution on the four
subsystems is realized. 

<h3>Device dependent commands and PARA files</h3>
Throughout this example, we have shown SIMCAM methods using keyword
arguments with default values for device-dependent commands invoked by
the OCS.  In the case of SOSS, there is an additional interface
specification for device-dependent commands, which is implemented via
"PARA" (parameter) files.
Essentially, each device-dependent command that can be issued from the 
OCS has an interface (PARA) file associated with it.  The file describes
the command name, parameters with their types, and default values.  The
format of PARA files is described elsewhere.  We mention them here to
note only that there is another location where default values to
paramters can be set.  SIMCAM can load and use these PARA files to
interpret the values coming from the OCS.

<h3>SOSS status aliases</h3>
It should be noted that the OCS status aliases referring to instrument
status can be completely different from the keys used on the SIMCAM side
(or you can choose to keep them in sync, for clarity, if you wish).
Such aliases on the OCS side are typically the instrument 3-character
code as prefix, followed by a dot and then an alphanumeric suffix.  For
example, our <code>status</code> value from earlier may be known on the
SOSS side as <code>MNI.STATUS</code> (assuming that "MYI" is the code
for "My New Instrument").
