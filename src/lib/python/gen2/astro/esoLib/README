This module is the python wrpper for eso rtdlib library functions.
It provides the functions that take numpy objects as input parameters. 

One caveat is that the rtdlib uses float instead of double and the python
floating point type is double. This causes situations where although you
see the number with many dicimal points returned from the function, only
5-7 decimal digits are actually correct. 

Currently only the iqe() function is working, but only slight modifications
are required to have the funciton work with other functions like iqebgv(),
etc.

To compile and install the module, just type

python ./setup.py install 

with appropreate options (like --prefix=).

Look at the included test.py for usage example.

TODO:
  prefix the module with appropreate package (i.e. EsoLib).
  support more functions.
