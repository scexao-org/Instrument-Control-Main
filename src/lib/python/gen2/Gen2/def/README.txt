Notes on creation of files in .../python/Gen2/def

UT1_UTC.table:
==============

UT1_UTC.table is simply copied from the Summit SOSS system; e.g.:

    ssh dbs1
    cd /oss_data/OBS_NFS
    scp -p UT1_UTC.table vega:/home/bon/Svn/python/Gen2/def

When SOSS is no longer in use, the method SOSS uses will have to be copied
for Gen2.  I believe this is a cron job that copies UT1_UTC.table from
NIST.    



StatusDecodeTab.def:
====================

This is the decoding table file used by STATdecode.py.  It is the Gen2
equivalent of StatusAlias.def, and is currently generated by running
STATdecode.py as a program, with input from StatusAlias.pro, StatusAlias.def 
and StatusTSCV.def.  These files are copied from the most current SOSS
build, after generating StatusAlias.def according to the instructions in
http://ssdweb.subaru.nao.ac.jp/info/support/InstallingSossSoftwareSvn.html .
For example, from /home/builder/Svn/soss080825/config/OSS/GLOBAL_DEBUG/OSS_SYSTEM:/

  scp -p StatusAlias.def StatusAlias.pro StatusTSCV.def bon@vega:/home/bon/Svn/python/Gen2/def

Then the following command was used to generate StatusDecodeTab.def in the 
same directory:

  /home/bon/Svn/python/SOSS/STATint/STATdecode.py -p . -D StatusDecodeTab.def

See the doc file for STATdecode.py for more information:

  .../python/SOSS/STATint/STATdecode.html

NOTE: derived aliases, e.g. STATL.*, STATS.*, FITS.*, do not have entries in
StatusDecodeTab.def.  StatusDecodeTab.def's purpose is to guide decoding of
blocks of memory or RPC packets packed with status values, such as TSC tables
and instrument status tables.  Aliases represented in StatusDecodeTab.def
include the following families:

    TSCS.*, TSCL.*, TSCV.*
    ANAD.*, ANAQ.* 
    AOS.*, CAC.*, CIAO.*, FMS.*, OHS.*, WAV.*
    OBCD.*, OBCQ.*, OBSL.*, OBSS.*
    INSFOCUS.*
    VGW.*, VGWD.*, VGWQ.*

plus a few isolated alias names.
