<h1>Gen2 Precheck</h1>
<em>Please report any inaccuracies to the OCS support (ocs@naoj.org).</em>

<h2>Gen2 Precheck Procedure</h2>
<ol>
<li> Call OCS support (640-7109) and let them know you are starting Gen2 precheck.  If there
     is no answer, leave a message and try 640-7123.  If still no answer, leave a second 
     message and proceed.
     <p>
<li> Click <a target="new" href="/plugin/sm/sm_edit/main">here</a> to configure for the nights
     observation. In the bottom of the new window, under "Configure from OPAL", find the TSR
     for Program 1 of tonight's observations.  Click the "Configure" button at the end of
     the row.  If there is no TSR, or you are unsure of which one to configure, call OCS.
     <p>
<li> After configuring the observation, verify that it shows the correct information in
     the result.  Click the propid hyperlink to obtain the username and password for the
     <tt>ana</tt> login (you can print that page out if necessary).
     <p>
<li> Log into the observation workstations (left, middle, right) as the
    "Observation User".  Using the "Login" info from the previous step,
    log into the analysis workstation (<tt>ana</tt>). 
     <p>
<li> On each of the observation workstations the Gen2 Display Server should be running
    shown by a little box with the word in green: "Gen2".  If this is
    not running, start it by double-clicking the icon on the desktop. 
     <p>
<li> On <tt>ana</tt>, start the Gen2 ANA menu by right-clicking on the desktop and
     selecting "Gen2 ANA" from the pop-up desktop menu.
     <p>
<li> In the ANA Menu window, press the "FitsViewer" button and confirm that the FITS Viewer 
     GUI pops up.
     <p>
<li> Click <a target="new" href="/plugin/dsp/dspctl/start?loc=summit&mode=control">here</a> to connect
     the summit displays.
     <p>
<li> Click <a target="new" href="/plugin/bm/restart/10.0?sort=level">here</a> to restart/reconfigure the 
     GUIs for this observation.  When the GUIs have completely restarted, verify that you see
     the following GUIs: VGW subsystem (6 windows), IntegGUI, FITS Viewer, TelStat.  Verify
     that IntegGUI shows the correct PropID and tabs for the allocated instrument.
     <p>
<li> Click <a target="new" href="/plugin/tsc/tscctl/view">here</a> to go to the telescope login page.
     Click Safety Lock "Off".  If Gen2 is not logged in, click "Login".  If mode is TSC, then 
     click "OBS".
     <p>
<li> In IntegGUI, click on the "TELESCOPE2" command launcher, scroll down to the bottom and 
     click the "Gen2 Precheck" button.  Follow the onscreen pop-ups.
     <p>
<li> Call OCS support (640-7109) and let them know you finished the Gen2 precheck.  If there
     is no answer, leave a message and try 640-7123.  If still no answer, leave a second 
     message.
