README -- 2005-03-01

This is the main TelStat directory.  It contains the following files:
    OSSO_TelStat            the main TelStat program
    OSSC_screenPrint_sim    TelStat's OSSO_screenPrint simulator program
    README                  this file
    makefile                makefile for delivering and installing TelStat

It contains additional files with the following extensions:
    .sh     shell scripts to support installing and running TelStat
    .hlp    text for Help pull-down menu items
    .au     sound clips for audible alerts
    .xbm    the stipple pattern for the telescope ray graphic overlay
    .txt    detailed documentation on how status alias values are 
               interpreted and used by TelStat

Subdirectory OSSO_TelStatLib contains all of the .py files that 
have all of the TelStat Python code not contained in OSSO_TelStat 
and OSSC_screenPrint_sim.  These files implement the panes of the
TelStat window and all of the other TelStat features.

Subdirectory doc contains miscellaneous documentation files.
Some of these relate to new features or algorithms requested
for implementation, and others are crib sheets with notes on
delivering and running TelStat.  The doc subdirectory is not
delivered.

Notes on using make:
Python requires no compilation, so the only purpose for this makefile
is to facilitate delivery and installation.  For this reason, the
default target does nothing.  The make targets that will be
most often used are:

    deliver     creates tar file for copying to DBS
    install     once a tar file created by the deliver target is
                un-tarred into /soss/SSD/product/OSSO/OSSO_TelStat.d
                on a DBS host, "make install" will copy to the install 
                destination directories

The deliver target uses 2 macros which will commonly be overridden
on the make command line.  These are:

    DELIVERDIR   = /home/bon/proj/soss/delivery
    DELIVERNAME  = TelStat-RL1_0_13-rc11

So a typical make deliver command might be something like this:

    make deliver DELIVERDIR=~/delivery DELIVERNAME=test
